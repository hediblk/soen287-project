### Technologies used
We are using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend. **tailwindcss** is also used for styling.

**Node.js** will be used for the backend in the next deliverable.


## Project Structure
This deliverable only concerns the frontend part of the project. Most features are either static or simulated with dummy data as we are not connected to the backend yet to perform calculations, store or validate data.

## User Guide


## Running the project
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. To build the CSS file using tailwind, run:<br>`npx tailwindcss -i src/styles/input.css -o src/styles/output.css --watch`
4. Make sure to have `Live Server` extension installed on VSCode
5. Run the project using `Live Server` extension on VSCode by right clicking on `landingPage.html` and selecting `Open with Live Server`.
This will open the project in your default browser.

>***Note:** Since we are using js local storage feature, you cannot directly run the project in the browser as usual*
